# React Native FlatList Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug in React Native's FlatList component when dealing with large datasets and specific rendering optimizations. The issue causes items to render in incorrect positions or disappear completely, especially during rapid scrolling.

## Problem

The problem occurs when using FlatList with a significant amount of data and potentially when optimizations like `windowSize` are set to improve performance. Under certain conditions, particularly with rapid scrolling, items may appear in the wrong positions, become duplicated, or disappear from the list entirely.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully considering the `windowSize` parameter, potentially using the `getItemLayout` prop to improve performance, and testing with different data sizes and scroll patterns to find the cause of the inconsistency. Sometimes, refactoring the data structure or rendering logic can improve stability.  The solution also shows explicit key management to prevent issues stemming from reordering.
